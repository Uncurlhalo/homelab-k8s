This repo contains Terraform modules to create a simple multi-control node/multi-worker node Kubernetes cluster. At the moment it simply creates the infrastructure. I plan to automate the configuration with Kubespray down the road. There is currently no documentation but I hope to turn this into a blog post when complete to document my journey which would include more detailed docs.
